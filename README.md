## What's 'Kategorici'?

Kategorici is an article sharing platform with tags. The only ting is making it different from the others is you can not search something normally, you either need a link or you need to find it from tag. 

## Why should we use Kategorici?

Actually, I really don't know. I made it just because I was bored.
